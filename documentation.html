<h2>1. Design Process</h2>

<p>
    To start this project, I looked through the dataset and tried to figure out what question I
    wanted to answer. Since the dataset includes different video game genres and their sales,
    I decided to focus on which genres have the highest global sales. Before doing anything
    in D3, I sketched out a few ideas on paper just to get a feel for how the visualization
    might look.
</p>

<p>
    My first sketch was a vertical bar chart. This was the idea I felt most drawn to from the beginning, because bar charts make it really easy to compare categories like genres.
    Each bar would represent a genre, and the height would show the total global sales.
</p>

<p>
    I also sketched out a horizontal bar chart as an alternative. I wanted to see if it would 
    work better, especially since some genres have longer names. Horizontal bars can help with 
    label readability, so I made a quick version to compare. Even though it was a good option, 
    I still preferred the vertical layout.
</p>

    The last sketch I made was focused on interaction. I knew I wanted tooltips so users could 
    hover over each bar and see the exact sales values. This keeps the chart clean but still 
    lets people get more details if they want them.

<h2>2. Rationale for Design Choices</h2>

<p>
    I chose a vertical bar chart because it’s the clearest way to compare categories like 
    video game genres. Putting the genres on the x-axis and using the height of each bar to 
    show total global sales makes the comparison really straightforward.
</p>

<p>
    For color, I kept things simple. Since the focus of the visualization is the height of the 
    bars, using one main color helps prevent distraction. Too many colors might make it seem 
    like the colors mean something when they don’t, so keeping it clean felt like the best choice.
</p>

<p>
    Tooltips were added because showing exact numbers on the bars would clutter the visualization 
    and make it harder to read. This way the chart stays clean, but the user can still get precise 
    values by hovering.
</p>

<p>
    I also made sure the axes and labels were easy to read. The title explains exactly what the 
    chart shows, and the layout has enough spacing so nothing feels crowded.

<h2>3. Findings / Insights</h2>

<p>
To answer my question about which video game genres have the highest global sales, I used my bar chart to compare the totals across all the genres in the dataset. Having everything lined up made it really simple to see which genres sold the most. Sorting the bars helped too because it instantly showed which ones stood out at the top and which ones were much lower.
</p>

<p>
From the chart, <strong>Action</strong> clearly had the highest global sales. Its bar was noticeably taller than all the others, and the tooltip confirmed it was over 1,700 million units sold. Right after that, <strong>Sports</strong> and <strong>Shooter</strong> also had very high totals. These three definitely lead the market based on the data.
</p>

<p>
Genres like <strong>Role-Playing</strong>, <strong>Platform</strong>, <strong>Misc</strong>, and <strong>Racing</strong> landed more in the middle. They still showed a lot of sales, just not close to the top three. The difference in bar height made that really easy to notice.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the chart were <strong>Puzzle</strong>, <strong>Adventure</strong>, and <strong>Strategy</strong>. These had the smallest bars, and the tooltips confirmed their totals were much lower compared to the highest-selling genres.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the visualization helped me see the differences in global sales pretty clearly. The tooltips let me check exact values when I needed them, and the sorted layout made the ranking straightforward from highest to lowest.
